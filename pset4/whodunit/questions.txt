1.  stdint.h is a C header file that defines fixed-width integer data types. 

2.  They allow consistency of a C-program between different environments by maintaining the
    the same integer widths/sizes. In the case of whodunit, they make sure that bitmap
    file headers always have the same size and, thus, consistent memory addresses.

3.  BYTE is 1 byte. DWORD and LONG are both 4 bytes. WORD is 2 bytes.

4.  ASCII: B & M, Decimal: 66 & 77, HEX: 42 & 4d

5.  bfSize contains the byte size of the whole bitmap file while biSize contains the byte
    size only of the BITMAPINFOHEADER data structure.

6.  It indicates a top-down bitmap, the RGB color table will render with the upper-left
    corner as its origin.

7.  biBitCount

8.  When fopen fails to open a given file.

9.  Because we only expect one instance of the data structure being read at a time.

10. 3 bytes

11. fseek moves the position indicator in the current file pointer being read.

12. It tells fseek to move the position indicator relative to the current position in
    the file.
